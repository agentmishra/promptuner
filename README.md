3. Provide a one-sentence summary of the email.
4. Extract the sender's email address.

prompt.apply_decorator([
    Scratchpad(repeat=1),

Subject: Urgent: Project Deadline Extension Request

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request an extension for the upcoming project deadline. Due to unforeseen circumstances, including a critical team member's illness and some technical challenges we've encountered, we're slightly behind schedule.

We've made significant progress, but we need an additional week to ensure we deliver a high-quality product. I believe this extension will allow us to address all remaining issues and exceed your expectations.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if you'd like to discuss this matter in more detail. I appreciate your understanding and look forward to your response.

Best regards,
John Doe
Project Manager

# Define class labels
CLASS_LABELS = "Work-related, Personal, Spam, Urgent, Newsletter, Other"

# Use the prompt to analyze the email
response = prompt(

        "CLASS_LABELS": CLASS_LABELS
